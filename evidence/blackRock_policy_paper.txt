Black Rock Energy Coalition Policy Paper: "Securing America's Energy Foundations"

Executive Summary:
Our nation's energy security depends on robust domestic production of traditional energy resources. We advocate for policies that prioritize coal as a strategic mineral reserve, ensuring a stable supply for power generation and industrial use.

Key Recommendations:
1. Establish a strategic reserve of coal and coal-derived products to safeguard against supply disruptions.
2. Mandate a minimum 180-day reserve capacity for coal-based energy generation.
3. Implement regulatory frameworks that secure domestic energy foundations and reduce dependence on foreign energy imports.
