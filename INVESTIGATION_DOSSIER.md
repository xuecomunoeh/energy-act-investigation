# Investigation Dossier: National Energy Independence Act

## Introduction

This dossier documents an ongoing investigation into the potential influence of the Black Rock Energy Coalition, a powerful coal industry lobbying group, on the National Energy Independence Act. The bill, currently under debate, ostensibly promotes a diverse energy mix, but evidence suggests that key amendments have been shaped to favor coal interests at the expense of environmental protections and genuine energy independence.

## Analysis of Amendment 4B

Amendment 4B, titled "Strategic Mineral Reserves," was introduced as part of the National Energy Independence Act. Our analysis reveals striking similarities between the language of this amendment and policy recommendations published by the Black Rock Energy Coalition.

### Key Findings:

1. **Identical Phrasing**: The amendment's clause "secure domestic energy foundations" appears verbatim in the Black Rock Energy Coalition's policy paper "Securing America's Energy Foundations."

2. **Parallel Recommendations**: Both documents call for a strategic reserve of coal and coal-derived products with a minimum 180-day capacity.

3. **Priority to Coal**: The amendment explicitly prioritizes coal as a "critical mineral" for domestic energy production, mirroring the lobbying group's advocacy for coal as a strategic resource.

### Conclusion:

The textual overlaps and alignment of policy objectives strongly suggest that Amendment 4B was directly influenced by the Black Rock Energy Coalition, raising concerns about industry capture of the legislative process.
