# Investigation Dossier: National Energy Independence Act

## Introduction

This dossier documents an ongoing investigation into the potential influence of the Black Rock Energy Coalition, a powerful coal industry lobbying group, on the National Energy Independence Act. The bill, currently under debate, ostensibly promotes a diverse energy mix, but evidence suggests that key amendments have been shaped to favor coal interests at the expense of environmental protections and genuine energy independence.
